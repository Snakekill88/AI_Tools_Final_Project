### Problem
Given a software package and details of its repository can we predict the odds of a patch fixing a given defect (goal â‰¥ $50\%$)

### Background
This would be good for product owners of software packages as it could help them estimate the time it would take to bugfix a given program

### Model Strategy
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

### Feature Engineering
Calculating Cyclomatic complexity

### Complementary Datasets
1. Creating a dataset via GitHub API to add more data. 
2. Dataset about projects on GitHub.
